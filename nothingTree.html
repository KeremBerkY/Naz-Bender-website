              The Earth is 4.6 billion years old.<br />

            <p>

              we have destroyed more than 50% of the world’sforests.

          Mycorrhizal networks.<br />
          The fine, hairlike root tips of trees join together with microscopic
          fungal filaments to form the basic links of the network, which appears
          to operate as a symbiotic relationship between trees and fungi, or
          perhaps an economic exchange. As a kind of fee for services, the fungi
          consume about 30 percent of the sugar that trees photosynthesize from
          sunlight. The sugar is what fuels the fungi, as they scavenge the soil
          for nitrogen, phosphorus and other mineral nutrients, which are then
          absorbed and consumed by the trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          To communicate through the network, trees send chemical, hormonal and
          slow-pulsing electrical signals, which scientists are just beginning
          to<br />
          decipher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trees can detect scents through their leaves, which, for Peter
          Wohlleben, qualifies as a sense of smell. They also have a sense of
          taste. When elms and pines come under attack by leaf-eating
          caterpillars, for example, they detect the caterpillar saliva, and
          release pheromones that attract parasitic wasps. The wasps lay their
          eggs inside the caterpillars, and the wasp larvae eat the caterpillars
          from the inside out.<br />
          “Very unpleasant for the caterpillars,” says Wohlleben. “Very clever
          of the trees.”

            Trees share water and nutrients through the networks, and also use
            them to communicate. They send distress signals about drought and
            disease, for example, or insect attacks, and other trees alter their
            behavior when they receive these messages.”<br />

            Simard helped identify something called a hub tree, or “mother
            tree”. Mother trees are the largest trees in forests that act as
            central hubs for vast below-ground mycorrhizal networks. A mother
            tree supports seedlings by infecting them with fungi and supplying
            them the nutrients they need to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mother trees are the biggest, oldest trees in the forest with the
            most fungal connections. They’re not necessarily female, but Simard
            sees them in a nurturing, supportive, maternal role. With their deep
            roots, they draw up water and make it available to shallow-rooted
            seedlings. They help neighboring trees by sending them nutrients,
            and when the neighbors are struggling, mother trees detect their
            distress signals and increase the flow of nutrients accordingly.

            <p>
              At the end of the workshop, there will be a questionnaire to get
